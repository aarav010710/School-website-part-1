        <p>School Visit</p>
        <p> Schedule a School Visit All families considering admission to NWS are strongly encouraged to visit the School. These can be booked online or through the Front Desk. â€‹ A typical visit consists of a talk with a member of the admission staff, a tour of the campus with a teacher or wing head, and a family conference at which the staff member answers questions about the School, to convey a sense of how NWS will fit into their school search.</p>
